👋 My name is Atichat<sup>(neaL367)</sup>, and I&apos;m a 21-year-old student at Sripatum University in Thailand, where I&apos;m studying nformation and Communication Technology. My passion lies in front-end web development, but I&apos;m always excited to take on new challenges.

One of my dreams is to make my own video games, and I'm really interested in the pixel art style. I like to lose myself in the worlds made by [Rockstar Games](https://www.rockstargames.com/) when I&apos;m not studying or coding.

If you’d like to see my [projects](/p), which I work on in my own time, or browse through my [notes](/n), where I keep useful insights and ideas, you can find everything here including my [resume](/r).
