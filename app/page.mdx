# 👋 Hi, I'm Neal367

I'm a developer and volunteer. I am currently pursuing my studies in information and technology at Sripatum University. I've been sharing knowledge about IT for people who are underprivileged as a volunteer speaker.

My dream is to be a game developer by making my own. It's interesting how every technology breakthrough improves DX much better with listening to chill music while working. at last I'm a [Rockstar Games](https://rockstargames.com) fan.
