Hello and welcome. In this article, I share the tools and frameworks that I use daily in web development.

## 1. Frameworks: Next.js, Angular, and Astro

### [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) üóΩ
Next.js is my primary tool for building robust web applications. I rely on TypeScript to maintain code quality, and I appreciate its Server Components and server-side data fetching capabilities.

#### Example: Server Components for Data Fetching
```tsx
export default async function Page() {
  const response = await fetch('https://api.example.com/data');
  const items = await response.json();
  return (
    <ul>
      {items.map((item) => (
        <li key={item.id}>{item.name}</li>
      ))}
    </ul>
  );
}
```

I also use the `next-intl` package to create multilingual sites. For a live example, please visit [youthplusthailand.com](https://youthplusthailand.com).

- [My Old Portfolio Website](https://atichat-old.vercel.app/)

### [Angular](https://angular.dev/)
Angular is my choice for large-scale, enterprise-level applications. Its comprehensive framework is well suited for complex projects.

#### Hopeisapp: A Social Application
Hopeisapp is a social platform developed by a team of dedicated volunteers. Completed in two months, it offers:
- An engaging frontend interface
- Real-time character interaction
- Interactive quizzes
- A highly customizable theme system
- Reliable local storage to preserve user progress
- A user interface enhanced with daisyUI
- Responsive modals and forms

To explore the project, visit [Hopeisapp Website](https://hopeis.us) or review the [source code on GitHub](https://github.com/goodgeekclub/hopeisapp).

### [Astro](https://astro.build/) üí´
For static websites that require fast load times, I use Astro. Its content collections feature simplifies the management of various content types such as Markdown, MDX, and JSON. This approach streamlines the process of building content-rich sites.

<summary className="text-zinc-500 text-[15px] mb-2 hover:cursor-pointer">Content Collections</summary>

Astro's content collections allow me to organize and validate data efficiently. By specifying expected file types and structures, I can ensure that all content is consistent and well-managed.

## 2. Styling

### [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/) üå™Ô∏è
Tailwind CSS provides a utility-first approach to styling. It allows me to write efficient, responsive styles directly in my markup while keeping the overall CSS bundle minimal.

#### Advantages of Tailwind CSS:
- Enables inline styling that integrates well with the code.
- Helps maintain a small, optimized CSS bundle.
- Easily integrates with existing CSS when needed.

### [shadcn/ui](https://ui.shadcn.com/) üóø
shadcn/ui offers a collection of accessible components that help create a polished user interface with minimal effort.

### [motion](https://motion.dev/)
For smooth and responsive animations, I rely on framer-motion. This tool enhances the user experience with refined and seamless transitions.

## 3. Hosting and Deployment

### Vercel
I deploy modern web applications on Vercel, which is highly optimized for Next.js applications.

### AWS
For additional cloud services, I use AWS:
- **[CloudFront](https://aws.amazon.com/cloudfront/):** Accelerates content delivery.
- **[S3](https://aws.amazon.com/s3/):** Provides scalable storage for static assets.
- **[EC2](https://aws.amazon.com/ec2/):** Offers flexible cloud computing resources.

### Plesk and WordPress
I also work with traditional hosting platforms. In addition to the classic example of [dseelin.co.th](https://dseelin.co.th), I have developed websites using WordPress. One notable example is [QL Healthcare Thailand](https://qlhealthcarethailand.com/), which is a healthcare-focused site built on WordPress.

## 4. Community Involvement

Beyond my technical work, I organize IT workshops and volunteer for projects that help others improve their technical skills. I believe in giving back to the community and supporting the growth of aspiring developers.

Thank you for reading this overview of my tech toolbox.
