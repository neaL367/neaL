Hi this writing talk about me, Atichat (Neal367).

I spend most of my time sitting in front of a monitor, trying to turn code into something that feels cinematic. Currently, I am navigating the world of `Information and Technology` at Sripatum University. But beyond the degree, I am a builder following my curiosity through the digital landscape.

## The Rockstar Influence

I am a massive `Rockstar Games` fan. To me, they are the gold standard of world-building. What fascinates me isn't just the scale, but the obsession with detail—the way light hits a surface or how a sound fades out.

My ultimate goal is to become a `Game Developer` and create experiences that feel just as immersive. I want to master that same level of detail in my own projects. I believe that every digital world should feel like it has a soul, and that starts with the tiny things most people don't even notice.

## Home-cooked Knowledge

Beyond my own terminal, I spend my time as a `volunteer speaker`. I share IT knowledge with people who are underprivileged because I believe technology is the ultimate equalizer.

Teaching someone how to code feels a lot like cooking at home. It is not about being a professional chef; it is about the craft. When I simplify a complex concept for an aspiring developer, I am not just giving them a lecture—I am giving them a tool to change their future. It is one of the most rewarding parts of my journey.

## Precision Registry

I work best with `chill music` and a clear head. I call my philosophy `Precision Registry`. It is my personal pursuit of sub-pixel perfection and 60FPS smoothness.

While I use AI to `speed up` the process, I never let it take over. As I have written before, if you do not understand the lines of code you are path that you will never come back to. AI is my tool, not my replacement. Knowing exactly how the engine runs is what allows me to push the boundaries of what is possible.

## The Footprint

This site is my footprint. It is where I document my experiments with `Next.js`, my photography, and my thoughts on `vibe coding`. I am always looking for that next breakthrough that makes the `DX` even better.

The only constant in my career has been following my curiosity. I am still learning, still coding, and still waiting for the next big thing.

At last, thank you for reading. This is just the beginning of my journey in this digital world.

Thank for reading.🙂
