As a dedicated front‑end developer and event organizer at GoodGeekClub, I drive community‑focused IT initiatives that both upskill participants and generate positive social impact.

- **Led end‑to‑end web development** for [QL Healthcare Thailand](https://qlhealthcarethailand.com/), architecting and deploying a WordPress site that enhanced visibility for healthcare providers and streamlined patient outreach.

- **Co‑created "HopeIsApp"** a community‑driven social platform delivered in just two months. I implemented real‑time character interactions, dynamic quizzes, and a fully customizable UI powered by `daisyUI`, with client‑side progress persistence via local storage. ([GitHub](https://github.com/goodgeekclub/hopeisapp))

- **Engineered and managed** the [dseelin.co.th](https://dseelin.co.th) WordPress site on Plesk—integrating custom plugins and SEO best practices—and deployed a multilingual Next.js site for [youthplusthailand.com](https://youthplusthailand.com), leveraging `next‑intl` for seamless internationalization.

- **Provisioned and maintained Amazon Linux 2 servers**—installed and configured LAMP stacks, set up SSL/TLS certificates, and hosted WordPress blogs on EC2 instances for secure, performant environments.

- **Configured S3 static website hosting**—enabled website hosting on S3 buckets, specified index and custom error documents, implemented advanced JSON redirection rules, and validated endpoints via both the AWS console and CLI to deliver fast, reliable static sites.
