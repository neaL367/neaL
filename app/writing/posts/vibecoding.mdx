Hi this writing talk about my experience of vibe coding for months.

`Vibe coding` is my personal way of getting more like be lazy and learning curve is going down. 
No more stack overflow and less searching if you can solve the bugs, add new features just a few prompt. 

The result is will not even figure out what where of the problem is including the solution to solved that or even worst is just let all an issues to AI.

> In fact it's messy if you don't even try to `reading` and `understanding` any lines of code that is path that you will never come back to.

In the dark aways has tiny light. 

I think above of all this is `education of failed`, but I sit front of monitor coding hours and hours. 

It's call `focusing` that you will get. It's normal if WTH and you can manage anything and many things attract you that make you possibly will loss focus.

If you learning with AI like `what` is this, `how` it working, `try` this way instead, `explain` me this function.
and you will feeling how fast that project is, it's just let you reading more what is AI coding for and learning with it together.

My advice:
- Good result will come with good productivity
- Use AI as a tool not slave labor
- Note everything you learn

At last, This is `my 1st writing` without vibe writing or ai and English not my mother language so some of sentences and words not very good that much but let me cook in the future.

Thank for reading.🙂
