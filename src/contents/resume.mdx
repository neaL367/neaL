<small className="flex text-sm text-gray-500 -mt-3 mb-3">Web Developer, 2022 - Present</small>

I have been an active volunteer at GoodGeekClub, organizing various IT events to promote skill development and create a positive impact on society. My experience includes developing and deploying multiple websites using a range of technologies.  

I built **[QL Healthcare Thailand](https://qlhealthcarethailand.com/)**, a healthcare-focused website on WordPress, providing an informative digital presence for healthcare services. Additionally, I contributed to **[Hopeisapp](https://hopeis.us/)**, a community-driven social platform developed by volunteers in just two months. This project features real-time character interactions, engaging quizzes, and a customizable theme system, leveraging daisyUI for an enhanced UI and local storage for saving progress. The source code is available on [GitHub](https://github.com/goodgeekclub/hopeisapp).  

Beyond these projects, I created a website with Plesk hosting and WordPress for **[dseelin.co.th](https://dseelin.co.th)** and deployed a static web page using Next.js for **[youthplusthailand.com](https://youthplusthailand.com)**, implementing an internationalization feature with next-intl. I also hosted static web pages on Amazon Web Services, utilizing CloudFront, S3, and EC2 to ensure scalability and performance.
